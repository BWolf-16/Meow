just a silly little website thing i made lol

basically you ask someone a question and the "no" button keeps changing text while the "yes" button gets bigger. pretty simple but it works

## what's in here

- index.html - the main page with the question
- yes_PAGE.HTML - what shows up when they click yes
- assets folder - has the cat gif

## how to use

just open index.html in a browser. that's it

you can customize the question in the html if you want. change the text, swap the gif, whatever

## notes

used comic sans because why not. the yes button grows every time someone tries to click no which is kinda funny

made this in like an hour so don't expect anything fancy
